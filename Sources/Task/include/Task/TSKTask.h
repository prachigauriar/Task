@class TSKWorkflow;
@protocol TSKTaskDelegate;

/*!
 TSKTask objects model units of work that can finish successfully or fail. While similar to
 NSOperations, the additional concepts of success and failure enable a greater range of behavior
 when executing a series of related tasks.

 For tasks to be useful, they must be added to a task workflow — a TSKWorkflow object. Task
 workflows provide an execution context for tasks and keep track of prerequisite and dependent
 relationships between them. While tasks can be started directly (using ‑start), they are more
 typically started by sending their workflow the ‑start message, which begins executing all tasks in
 the workflow that have no prerequisite tasks. When all of a task’s prerequisite tasks have finished
 successfully, the task will automatically be enqueued for execution. A task cannot be executed
 until all of its prerequisite tasks have completed successfully. If a task fails, it can be retried
 using the ‑retry message. See the TSKWorkflow documentation for more information on running tasks.

 To make a task perform useful work, you must subclass TSKTask and override ‑main. Your
 implementation should execute any operations necessary to complete your task, and invoke either
 ‑finishWithResult: or ‑failWithError: when complete. If you want to avoid subclassing, you can also
 use TSKBlockTask and TSKSelectorTask. See their respective class documentation for more information.

 Tasks have two types of prerequisites, keyed and unkeyed, which have a simple distinction: a keyed
 prerequisite has a unique key that can be used to retrieve its result, while an unkeyed prerequisite
 does not. Keyed prerequisites are primarily useful when a task has many prerequisites with different
 kinds of results. If your task ignores its prerequisites’ results, has only one prerequisite, or has
 many prerequisites whose results are treated uniformly, unkeyed prerequisites may be more convenient
 to use. Keyed and unkeyed prerequisites may also be used in combination, though this is rare. Task
 subclasses can declare which prerequisite keys are required by overriding ‑requiredPrerequisiteKeys.

 Every TSKTask has an optional delegate that can be informed when a task succeeds or fails. See the
 documentation for TSKTaskDelegate for more information.
